The S&P 500 index is currently exhibiting a mixed performance, with a 50-day moving average breadth of 68.1 and a 200-day moving average breadth of 44.6. This breadth indicates a relatively healthy short-term trend, although the longer-term outlook appears less robust. Sector returns have shown varied changes, with the XLB sector declining by 0.99%, XLC by 0.41%, and XLE by 1.41%. Conversely, the XLRE sector increased by 1.02%, and XLP saw a modest rise of 0.6%. The ratio of the response of SPY has also decreased slightly from 0.301 to 0.299, reflecting a percentage change of -0.56%. This decline in the response ratio suggests a potential weakening in market momentum, which could be a signal for investors to exercise caution in their trading strategies.

Market Pulse

The market experienced notable fluctuations yesterday, with the S&P 500 index closing at 5,939.30, down 0.53% from its previous close of 5,970.81. Significant stock movements included VICI Properties Inc. closing at $31.45, up 0.22%, while Halliburton and Trane Technologies saw declines of 0.3% and 0.42%, respectively. Despite Trane's impressive 6.23% rise over the past month, the overall sentiment was affected by a substantial 14.26% drop in Tesla shares, contributing to the Nasdaq Composite's decline of 0.83%. This marked the first drop for both indices in four days. The market's volatility was further compounded by President Trump's positive trade discussions with Chinese leader Xi Jinping, juxtaposed against expectations of a slowdown in hiring as upcoming labor market data is anticipated. The 10-Year Treasury Yield increased to 4.39%, reflecting a slight rise in the odds of a Federal Reserve rate cut. Meanwhile, the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) rose by nearly 5%, indicating heightened market uncertainty, particularly due to tariff threats from the Trump administration. In commodities, West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures closed at $63.17, up 0.51%, while gold futures saw a modest increase, reflecting ongoing concerns over economic growth, as the OECD cut its forecasts for 2025 and 2026.

Top Movers

Tesla (TSLA) shares faced a notable decline of 14% on Thursday, marking their worst trading day since March, although they managed to rebound by 0.8% in after-hours trading. The deterioration of the relationship between Elon Musk and President Trump has led to public exchanges of insults and raised concerns regarding potential regulatory scrutiny on Musk's businesses, including Tesla and SpaceX. Musk has openly criticized Trump's policies, warning that tariffs could precipitate a recession in 2025. Meanwhile, the broader Asia-Pacific market, excluding Japan, experienced a slight decline but remains on track for a weekly gain. Lucid Group (NASDAQ: LCID) is also feeling the pressure, as its share price declines amid a broader pullback in the electric vehicle (EV) sector, exacerbated by negative remarks from Tesla's CEO and macroeconomic challenges. Despite these hurdles, Lucid recently secured a multi-year supply agreement with Graphite One for American-sourced natural graphite, essential for future vehicle production, and reported its sixth consecutive quarter of record deliveries. In the AI sector, Nvidia (NVDA) continues to thrive, planning to reenter the China AI chip market with its new B40 processor and reporting a remarkable 69% year-over-year revenue increase to $44.1 billion in Q1. The company faces competition from Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), which has made strategic acquisitions to bolster its AI software ecosystem. In contrast, Ford Motor Company (F) closed at $10.24, up 0.49%, reporting a 16.3% increase in U.S. vehicle sales for May, despite concerns over future tariff-induced price hikes. Overall, the market is witnessing significant volatility, with various sectors experiencing both gains and losses as companies navigate complex economic landscapes.
